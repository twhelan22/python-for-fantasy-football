    "# Python for Fantasy Football - Getting and Cleaning Data\n",
    "Welcome to part 3 of the Python for Fantasy Football series! If you missed part 1 or 2, go back and check those out first before continuing. I've had a lot of positive comments on the series so far, and I really appreciate everyone taking the time to do so. Keep the feedback coming! The most common question I had was how I got the data in the first place, and since getting and cleaning data is a crucial skill for any coder it makes sense to focus on that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to access a webpage in Python\n",
    "There are several ways that you can access web data in Python. Here are four key methods, listed in order of preference:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if the site has an API (Application Programming Interface). If it does, the site has already done the hard work of creating a nice interface for you to access their data, along with instructions on how to use it. It's always worth checking this first before attempting to scrape the data.\n",
    "2. If the data you want is stored in a html table, you can read it into pandas directly using pd.read_html().\n",
    "3. If the first two options aren't possible, make a request to the url to grab the webpage and then use a html parser like BeautifulSoup to extract the information you want afterwards.\n",
    "4. If the site is using JavaScript, you will probably need a web driver like Selenium to help pull the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will show you how to get data using methods 2-4, and introduce some more pandas tools to help you to clean the data. Before we start scraping, however, it's essential that we know how to do it legally without causing any unintentional damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Responsible scraping\n",
    "Whilst most sites don't like being scraped, it's very difficult for them to stop it. After all, it's not that different from someone accessing the content through a browser. However, just because you can scrape doesn't mean you should. There are a few key guidelines to follow to ensure that you are scraping responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Respect robots.txt\n",
    "Most websites will have a robots.txt file, which is basically used to ask bots not to crawl certain parts of their site. For example, check out https://fantasy.premierleague.com/robots.txt. This basically reads as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear all robots,<br>\n",
    "It would be greatly appreciated if you respect the Robots Exclusion Standard and don't crawl the links we have gone to the trouble of disallowing here please. We can't stop you and if you aren't doing anything nasty you might get away with it, but don't be surprised if your IP address gets blocked, especially if you are making lots of requests to our server.<br>\n",
    "Regards,<br>\n",
    "Website Admin\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you are scraping responsibly there are no legal repercussions from ignoring robots.txt, but you should keep in mind that a site doesn't want you to scrape any pages they have chosen to disallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Read the TOS\n",
    "It's very important to check the terms and conditions of a site before scraping it. The TOS are a legal agreement, so ignoring them could get you in trouble. Fortunately, many sites will allow you to use their information for your own private and personal use as long as you aren't reproducing any of the data for commercial purposes. For example, have a look at the TOS at https://www.premierleague.com/terms-and-conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TOS state that downloading material from the site is allowed for your own private and personal use, which is great news for FPL fans. However, it's not 100% clear whether I would be in breach of the TOS by scraping the FPL site as an example for this article, so I'm not going to despite it being a popular request. I'll go through the basics of how to scrape in general, you'll have to decide for yourself whether you think it's OK to scrape a particular website or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Don't be a d*ck\n",
    "Websites will slow down or even crash if the load on the server exceeds capacity, which results in a terrible experience for everyone else. It's also likely to draw unwanted attention from the website admin and you might get IP blocked. As far as they are concerned, putting excess strain on their server is a malicious act, whether it's intentional or not! Ideally you should be trying to make a single request to a server to grab an entire webpage and parsing it out later, rather than constantly making a new request every time you want a specific piece of information. If you do have to make multiple requests try to do it outside of peak hours and add a time delay in between each one (if your scraper isn't running at a significantly faster speed than a human user could navigate the site, you should be fine).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using pandas to get data\n",
    "Sometimes, you will be lucky and find that the information you want is already stored in a nicely formatted html table. In this first example, we're going to get injury data from the excellent FantasyFootballScout website using one of the built-in functions from pandas."

    "As a general note for this series, I can't remember which packages come pre-installed with Anaconda and which don't, so if you get a 'module not found' error it's likely because it's not installed. To rectify that, open up an Anaconda prompt (like a command prompt) and type: 'conda install' followed by the module name, e.g. conda install beautifulsoup4, then press enter to run. This should download and install the package you want. Alternatively, you can use 'pip install' instead, which is the default method of installing Python packages (you will need this if not using Anaconca). If you get stuck, every module should have an installation guide in the documentation."

    "## Regular expressions\n",
    "In this case the names were in a clearly defined format, 'last (first)', so str.split() worked well. However, it won't always be that easy unfortunately! For more complicated problems you will probably be better off using 'regular expressions' (regex for short), which are a common feature of all programming languages. Regular expressions are essentially custom search patterns that allow you to find any combination of characters in a string. Whilst regular expressions are extremely useful, the downside is that they can often be confusing to understand, particularly if you are relatively new to coding, and I'm far from an expert myself. Unless you're a genius that uses regex every day, it's always best to Google the problem and use helper resources to remind yourself of the syntax. There are plenty of full tutorials on regular expressions so I'm not going to go too in-depth here, but I thought it was worth showing a quick example of how to use them. If you want to learn more, https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm is a good place to start."

If you have time, I highly recommend reading through the Beautiful Soup documentation https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ to get a good idea of how it works. A few people asked me how I got the xG data from www.understat.com for parts 1 and 2. The truth is that I actually just copied and pasted it, but we can do better than that! Let's see if we can scrape the table by using the requests library in conjunction with bs4."

However, if you check the full output you will notice that unfortunately the xG table we are after is inside a JavaScript element, which makes it difficult to access using this method. Recalling our options from earlier, we might need to use Selenium, which essentially just automates your browser to carry out tasks. Read through the unofficial documentation here https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#introduction to see how to install and use the Selenium WebDriver in Python. Selenium might seem complicated at first, but fortunately for the purposes of web scraping it's fairly straightforward to use."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "That's it for now! Every web page will have a slightly different structure, and it can take a bit of time to figure out exactly how to access the specific part of the html code you are interested in. That said, by using the techniques above you should be able to get any information you want, providing you aren't breaking any rules of course. If you have extra time, try out the exercises below to help reinforce the concepts from this part of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automate the injury checker.\n",
    "Hint: you will need to scrape some fixture dates instead of specifying next_fixtures explicitly.\n",
    "It would be a good idea to create a single dataframe that includes both players that are confirmed to be out and players that are less than 75% fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check if any players from your FPL team are questionable or out.\n",
    "One way to do this would be to create a list of the players in your team and see if there are any positive matches in the injury report dataframe.\n",
    "Even better if you can think of a way to suggest suitable replacements automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get rid of the unwanted text after the '+' or '-' symbol in the xG, xGA and xPTS columns (this just shows the difference between actual and expected goals/points).\n",
    "Hint: use either str.strip() or regular expressions (or both!), as we did before with the injury table.\n",
    "It's probably a good idea to change the column names as well, particularly the 'no.' column (or maybe you don't even need that column).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a function to get a clean xG table for a different league of your choosing on Understat.\n",
    "Note that good functions are as general as possible, meaning that you should be able to reuse it for any league or season just by changing the input parameters.\n",
    "If you have got this far, it should be pretty straightforward to just wrap your existing code inside a function."
